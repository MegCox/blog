## Did you know I studied biology?
Although I graduated from my biology degree in 2020, I've still been studying the last two years. Doing the law conversion. I love both, and am actually very excited to start my law job. But I do still have an interest in biology. So I'm of course going to include some biology posts in this blog. Expect a deep dive into common plants I've noticed in certain areas, or beautiful birds I've seen, or just some general observational ramblings.
