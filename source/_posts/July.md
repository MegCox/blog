*(The last two months it's been cloudy on the full moons, so this is the first time I've seen it.)*

1. Last: Workaway in Dobrusa, Slovenia, taking the dog Siba for an evening walk.
2. Current (14th July): Sat on the beach in Kotor, Montenegro with a group from the hostel, and Rosaline of course. We watched the full moon rise over the mountains.
3. Future: In Kotor again, volunteering at the hostel. Probably sat on the same beach.
