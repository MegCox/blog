## Leaning into the travelling hippy vibe
 When I notice a full moon I make a mental note of where I am, I think back to where I was on the last one, and I think forward to where I might be on the next one. It takes all of 1 minute to do but it's a nice moment of reflection. The world moves in cycles, and so do we. Noticing the little cycles specific to you are a personal, private affair, but observing the huge cycle of the moon seems like one that should be shared. So I plan on doing my personal piece of reflection on noticing a full moon in this space! 

Expect a short: 
1. this is where I am now; 
2. this is where I was on the last one; 
3. and this is where I think I might be on the next one.

It might lead to some interesting reflections, or just show how little forward planning I'm doing on this trip when my future prediction is completely wrong!
