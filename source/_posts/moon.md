## Leaning into the travelling hippy vibe
If you've seen my inner left bicep you may have noticed I have a tattoo of a full moon over the sea. This was my first tattoo, and inspired by my first solo travel experience. It was in Mexico in 2018. It was my last night there and I sat on the beach eating a burrito, drinking a cold beer and watching the sunset, followed by the full moon rising. A flock of pelicans started to fish in the sea right in front of where I sat on the sand. It's a moment I wanted to capture forever, and it's a moment I think back to a lot. Takeaway point: I really like observing full moons! When I notice a full moon I make a mental note of where I am, I think back to where I was on the last one, and I think forward to where I might be on the next one. It takes all of 1 minute to do but it's a nice moment of reflection. The world moves in cycles, and so do we. Noticing the little cycles specific to you are a personal, private affair, but observing the huge cycle of the moon seems like one that should be shared. So I plan on doing my personal piece of reflection on noticing a full moon in this space! 

Expect a short: 
1. this is where I am now; 
2. this is where I was on the last one; 
3. and this is where I think I might be on the next one.

It might lead to some interesting reflections, or just show how little forward planning I'm doing on this trip when my future prediction is completely wrong!
