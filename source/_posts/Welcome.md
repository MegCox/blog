My name is Meg. I’m travelling for the next 12 months, from England to Thailand across land. I wanted a place to properly record this trip - no highlight reel and no restraints. Complete freedom on what I write about, and a chance to actually write. Who knows what this blog will include, but definitely don’t expect consistency or beautiful prose. 

You’re very welcome to join me on the evolution of this page and, more importantly, my trip.

Route plan:

*Disclaimer: You might note that my route goes through a few war zones, but don't worry I'm not completely insane! If they are still not great places to travel through (I'm not holding my breath), I will fly over them. Currently it's looking like I'll be flying from Uzbekistan to Nepal, and from Nepal to Thailand.*
