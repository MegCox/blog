## Won't you get lonely travelling alone?
The massive misunderstanding of what travelling alone means! As I've happily explained to several people recently, travelling alone doesn't mean I'm going to be alone. In fact, I'll probably be with people most of the time. The people I meet will form as important part of my memories of this trip as the sights I see. I truly love meeting new people, hearing about their lives and getting to know them. I'd like to record these experiences, sharing people's lives along with my other travel experiences (with permission of course!). 

Expect some Humans of New York style pieces here.
