Istanbul was a city I already had a perception of before visiting: that it was unbelievably busy and loud and chaotic. This was reinforced with opinions of many other travellers I’d spoken to, especially women who often had negative experiences to share. I was glad to therefore be travelling with my brother for this part! The Istanbul I experienced completely shocked me. It wasn’t at all like this intense mess I’d imagined. It was peaceful. It was busy in places sure, but not noticeably busier than other major European cities. Certain areas were so trendy, filled with chic cafes, homemade design shops and vintage clothing stores (Kadikoy in particular, on the Asian side). We were constantly finding ourselves in manicured squares with water features. We stayed in Karakoy on the European side, which is the more commercial district right by Galata tower. This was a fun contrast, the street our hostel was on was filled with repair shops which sold random parts for random items, but just one street over it was all fancy cafes and gift shops. I loved how the two sides of Istanbul - touristy and commercial - seamlessly alternated. Of course the more famous ‘two sides’ are the European and the Asian sides. After listening to some podcasts on the history of Istanbul I want to note that while Istanbul is the gateway to the East for me, and this is how it’s perceived by many Westerners, historically it’s the other way around. Ancient history played out in the East, and Istanbul was the gateway to the West for them. The two sides were not particularly distinct, at least not more so than any of the neighbourhoods were. We spent most of our time on the European side, but if I were to ever live in Istanbul (unlikely, it’s a bit too big and urban for me) it would be in Kadikoy on the Asian side.

It was truly wonderful to spend my time in Istanbul with my brother. We have never travelled alone together before, nor spent so much time just the two of us. I was a bit apprehensive about it, with him being my younger brother I wasn’t looking forward to having to look after him and be responsible for us both. I didn’t give him enough credit, perhaps forgetting he is 21 years old now. He was perfectly responsible and helped out a lot. It was a real delight to travel with him and spend so much time together - if only to have a willing participant in my endless games of cards!

### What we did

1. **Sight seeing.** Unsurprisingly, most of our time was spent visiting the major sights. First up was the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia, which sit facing one another on opposite sides of Sultanahmet Square, like the two queens on a chessboard. The Blue Mosque was the first mosque Harvey and I had ever visited, taking off our shoes as instructed and with me wearing a headscarf. It was under heavy construction, so we could only really see the ceiling. The Hagia Sophia was originally a church then a mosque then a museum and, as of 2020, then a mosque again. Entrance to the mosque was free but there was a huge queue. Once inside it was nice to actually get to see the decorations unlike in the Blue Mosque. We sat on the carpet and took it all in. For me, as a non-religious person, it felt very similar to a cathedral. A short walk away was the Topkapi Palace so we did this next. It included waiting in three long queues, one for security to enter, one to buy our tickets, and one to collect the free audioguide. This was both mine and my brother’s favourite sight. We were amazed at how beautiful it was. It had three courtyards, with large buildings framing them and little ones spattered within. The gardens were wonderful, filled with flowers and water features. The tiling was beautiful, as were the columns and the huge low sofa style seats inside. The Ottoman influence was clear, and it was beautiful to see. The audioguide was also pretty good. Next up was the Grand Bazaar. Even this was less busy than I’d imagined. It was more similar to a covered market you’d find in England than I thought it would be. We saw a lot of tea sets and I found one I really liked, but as it was £80 for a set for two I decided to pass. The shops were very cool, especially the ones selling traditional clothing. It was huge, and we could’ve spent all day wandering around but I think Harvey would’ve murdered me if we did! All I ended up buying was a headscarf, ready to wear as I head to the more conservative East Turkey and beyond. The Spice Bazaar is very close by so we traversed the market streets which spill out of the Grand Bazaar to visit it. This was much smaller, and a lot more colourful. The shops sold spices, tea leaves and turkish sweets (turkish delight and baklava). I ate a huge amount of turkish delight in trying to decide which flavours to buy and felt quite sick by the time we left, but happy with my choices of a pistachio lokum (the roll form of turkish delight) and simple rose. 
2. **Bosphorus cruise.** Following in the footsteps of old school travellers to Istanbul, we rode the ferry all the way up the Bosphorus Strait to the last town before the Black Sea, Anadolu Kavağı. It took 1.5 hours and the return ticket cost 65TL (around £3). We enjoyed relaxing on the boat, watching Istanbul sail past. I had a Mr Bean moment when I got out my ticket to have a look at the route and forgot I also had Harv’s; it flew out of my purse in the wind, being carried through the bars in the railing and into the water. Oops. We arrived at the last town before the Black Sea, where we had 2.5 hours to explore before getting the boat back. We walked up to the castle on the hill, making a note of the military zone. It had a nice view of the Black sea but that was about it. We walked back to the main town, I thought it was very strange. Harv liked it, said it reminded him of Porlock Weir. We had balik ekmeks for lunch - fish sandwiches. I had a calamari one because the sample fish the guy gave us freaked me out, but Harv’s fish sandwich was much better than mine. Getting back on the boat the ticket guy either believed my sad tale of my ticket blowing away or just didn’t care, either way he let me on without it. It was a fun way to spend a day, and we had enough days to do it and not miss out on other things, but I’m not sure I’d recommend it too highly.
3. **Checked out the arts scene in a slightly different way.** Harv isn’t into art galleries so instead of visiting these we went to an old cinema to watch a turkish film (with english subtitles). It was quite odd but I enjoyed it. Harv fell asleep so I think he might’ve enjoyed it less. Annoyingly, we weren’t in the cool screening room with the original curved roof (see a picture below) but I was able to stick my head in to see it. We also spent one evening at a Jazz bar, sipping on whiskey sours and appreciating the live music. 
4. **Enjoyed the cafes and played cards.** As with any city visit, a lot of the time was spent sat in cafes resting our feet or planning our next move. Here we enjoyed really good coffee (not turkish coffee…) or herbal teas, and the abundance of sweet treats. Harv especially enjoyed the cheesecakes. We played a lot of cards throughout the trip, often at said cafes.
5. **Turkish bath.** After Harv left I visited a Hammam, see the post on this to read about the experience!

### Foood

We ate very well in Istanbul. We tried most of the traditional foods. The turkish breakfast impressed me, with it being comprised of lots of little bits which were fun to try. The doner we had was a bit disappointing, not tasting much different to the ones we’d eaten in England. I was more impressed by the dürüm, which was kebab meat in a wrap. Up until this point I thought I didn’t like baklava, finding it much too sweet and soggy. But here I really enjoyed it, finding it more nutty and way less sweet and soggy. The real star was a restaurant rather than a dish however. For the first time in my trip I ate at the same restaurant twice. It was a small place in Karakoy which served turkish food with a bit of a twist. The ambience was perfect - cool interior with soft jazz playing. On our first visit we had homemade ginger beer and delicious mains, followed by delicious desserts. By the end of the meal we had already decided to go back there the following evening. It’s called Karaköy Gümrük, definitely check it out if you’re ever in Istanbul. I also had to try a turkish burek (spelt borek here), and it was very good, up there as one of the better ones I’ve eaten.

### Leaving Istanbul

We spent 4 nights in Istanbul, and there was a lot more to see than we could ever cover in that time. But for me, 4 nights was enough. I’m not a big city person and this is a very big city. As surprisingly un-busy as I found it, it was still busy. It was also quite dirty. So I watched the sunset on my last evening and found myself ready to leave. Back travelling alone again after being with friends and family for the last few weeks. As a reminder that travelling isn’t all easy I managed to get completely lost trying to catch the metro to the bus station. The bus station itself isn’t centralised so there’s no information board, instead it’s all private companies with their own offices and platforms. I couldn’t find my bus or the company’s office at all, despite going to the coordinates they’d sent me with my ticket. The 45 minutes buffer time I’d given was dwindling away. No one seemed to be able to help me and I was getting a little stressed. Eventually I found a contact number and sent a whatsapp message to ask for help, with them giving me the correct location and I was able to find the bus with time to spare. The bus was very fancy, and during the overnight journey I was served tea and given a snack. I hope all buses in Turkey are the same!
