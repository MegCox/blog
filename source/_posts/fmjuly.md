### Full Moon Check-in

1. Last: In Vang Vieng, Laos.
2. Current: Heading out on the boat at 6am for a sunrise surf, we spotted the huge full moon coming over the hill behind us. The first half an hour of surfing was under the rising sun and the full moon. Magical. In Lombok, Indonesia.
3. Future: Back in England! Pretty insane to think about. Maybe Iâ€™ll still be down in Somerset, hopefully camping or doing something fun.
