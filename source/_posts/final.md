So, this is the end. Thank you so much for reading this blog and keeping me company on my trip. It means more than I can say. Having people reach out to let me know they enjoyed certain posts, or took inspiration from certain parts, enthused me in the most magnificent way. The act of travelling has been an insanely educational and rewarding experience but so has keeping this blog. And I have loved writing it so very much. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

To all of the people I met on my travels, thank you for making them so memorable. I had so many wonderful conversations and meals and games of cards and day trips and all sorts of other strange activities with so many of you.

I will of course travel again, but a big trip like this? That I don't know. For now, I'm starting my job as a corporate lawyer in London and will be focusing on that for the foreseeable future. So if you're passing through London please shoot me a message, I would love to meet up with travelling friends and live vicariously through you!

This year was the best and most important and influential year of my life so far. I can't overstate how much I have adored every single minute of it. I have never before felt so intensely alive so often. This is a reminder to do that thing you've been wanting to do for ages, it might just make you the happiest you've ever been. And one last reminder that things that are rewarding and amazing are also filled with difficult, rubbish bits that suck. You need both in life, and having both is unavoidable. Now go and travel if that's what you want to do!
