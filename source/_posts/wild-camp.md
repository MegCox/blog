Introducing the newest blog feature - Wild Camping! Firstly, here is an initial guide to Wild Camping, aimed at anyone with an itch to enter into the wild camping world.

### 1. Rules

To answer the frequently asked question of “is wild camping legal” succinctly - no. Land in the UK is almost always privately owned and you require the landowner’s permission to camp on it, otherwise it’s trespassing. However, practically speaking, this is only an issue if (a) the landowner sees you camping on their land, and (b) the landowner takes issue with this. I have **never** had any issues wild camping. 

To ensure you also have no issues, follow this advice:

1. Camp out of sight. For example, under the treeline, in a dip in the hill, or in a protected corner of a field. If no one knows you’re there, there won’t be any issues!
2. Leave no trace. Once you’ve packed up, there should be **nothing** that indicates you were there. I’m not just talking about litter (but absolutely do not leave litter), but also food scraps and even toothpaste spit. Obviously you will flatten the grass down a bit, but keep any land disturbances to a minimum.
3. Pitch up late, leave early. Minimise the amount of time your tent is up.
4. If you want to camp in a farmer’s field that’s in the vicinity of the farm, try and find them to ask for permission. They’ll often give it, and even let you know the best field to camp in (one free of animals!).
5. I prefer “public” land over private. By this I mean land owned by national parks or public bodies. The landowners of these are very unlikely to ever see you, unless there are national park rangers or something.

### 2. Bare minimum kit

Like all new hobbies, there is an initial barrier of having the correct equipment. But it’s a relatively low barrier, as you don’t need much and the kit you use for your first foray into wild camping doesn’t need to be good. Focus on getting out there for one night in good weather conditions. If you love it, you can start upgraded your kit as you learn what you personally like and need.

**Essential kit list**

1. A tent - To reiterate the above sentiment, this does not need to be a good tent. My first wild camp was in an 18EUR tent which had a waterproof rating of 0 and where the door was held closed with a single toggle at the top, no zip in sight. The only criteria is that it’s light enough that you can carry it from the car/whatever transport to find a wild camping spot.
2. Sleeping bag - Again, doesn’t have to be a lightweight, hiking one. Any will do!
3. Sleeping mat - A foam exercise mat works fine.
4. Rucksack - Whatever you use day-to-day will work, but even better if you have any sort of travelling rucksack with a hip strap.
5. Water bottle - Plastic is fine! For one night, take at least 1 litre (if not cooking with water). But to be safe, I’d take 1.5 litres.
6. Food - Something for dinner, something for breakfast. Could be cold pizza and a granola bar. Making hot food and drinks is one of my favourite aspects of camping, but you don’t need to have a stove for the first trip. Just make this number one on your upgrade list!

Nice to have, that you probably already own:

1. Portable charger - Just so there’s no worry about your phone dying.
2. Headtorch - Phone torch works fine, but a headtorch is better.

That’s all you need. Once you have these items, no more excuses, plan a one night trip and go for it!

### 3. Making a plan

You’ve got the kit together, now how on earth do you start actually going wild camping??? Ponder no more. Just follow these simple steps for you first time wild camping:

1. Identify a weekend where you are free.
2. Select the general area. If you do not have access to a car, keep in mind public transport limitations. Selection could be based on knowledge that the area is the right vibe (because you’ve been there before or because someone you know has been there), or by researching areas suitable for wild camping near you online.
3. Confirm that there is a spot that looks like you could wild camp there. Use google maps satellite view to find a nice rural spot. If there is something listed on google maps (for example, a view point), check the photos. Check [Maps.me](http://Maps.me) as well, often people will list potential wild camping spots.
4. If you’re using a car, find a spot where you can park that is a manageable distance away (whatever this means for you).
5. Before you leave, **check the weather!!!** If you are doing this for the first time and are using a shitty tent, do not go if there is rain or wind forecasted.
6. On the day: leave plenty of time before it gets dark. Catch the bus/train or park you car up and walk to your identified spot. Leave so much time that if you can’t find anywhere you feel comfortable camping, you can just walk back to the station/your car.
7. Find a spot and camp!

### 4. Identifying a good wild camping spot

This is more of an art than a science. Firstly, it’s important to know that you can’t choose an exact spot in advance. It’s more of identifying a general area that looks promising, and as you are walking through this area you keep your eye’s peeled for a good spot.

Indicators of a “good spot”:

1. Out of sight from any paths or roads.
2. Not super exposed in terms of wind. Look for protection from hedges or dips.
3. Ground that you can peg your tent on. So not concrete, and soft sand isn’t great either.
4. A nice view. It’s meant to be a pleasurable experience remember!
5. A body of water to have a morning swim in.

### 5. Breathe

Be there and enjoy the spot. The fresh air, the breeze, the sounds, the space.
