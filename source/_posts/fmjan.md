### Full Moon Check-in

1. Last: In Yerevan, Armenia.
2. Current: I first saw it as the sun was setting, on the bus journey from Bishkek along the Issyl-Kul lake. It was beautiful. It lighted my way as I walked the 2km through the dirt streets of Bokonbayevo to my guesthouse.
3. Future: In some silk road city in Uzbekistan.
