Croatia is not my favourite place. It’s been unlucky in its placement next to Slovenia, as the contrast with this wonderful country makes Croatia look more sad than it probably deserves. I don’t know what it is about Croatia, but it just doesn’t speak to me. It doesn’t make me feel excited. I just don’t love it. It has a huge stretch of coastline, lots of islands and some cool national parks that are pretty green. But it still lacks something. The people aren’t the friendliest so that doesn’t help.

Places we visited (I was travelling with Rosaline for all of these):

1. Zagreb
I explored this city more on my journey down to Montenegro the first time around, and included a run down of it in that post. In overview, you can see it all in a couple hours. It’s fine.

2. Plitvice national park
Okay this place is very beautiful. I can’t argue with the views. BUT you can’t swim in the water, it’s very busy at the famous pretty bits and it’s not mind-blowing in any way.

3. Split
It’s prettier than I remembered from my last visit here 5 years ago. Nice old town. Very busy. Ferries to all of the islands.

4. Brac
Cheaper island alternative to the crazy expensive Hvar. Zlatni Rat beach was cool, and the promenade bit there was really nice. The main town of Supetar is pleasant. Seafood was good.

5. Korcula
The only place I’d recommend. I really liked this island. Was actually beautiful. Old town was cool, with a big bridge to get in. Just a pretty place.

6. Dubrovnik
The old town and the city walls are impressive. But it’s crazy expensive and busy and hot. You can see the old town in a day, you don’t need to stay overnight.

I’m not going to go into any more detail on Croatia. The islands and beaches are nice if you’re looking for just beaches and little old towns. For anything else, go somewhere else.
