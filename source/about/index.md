My name is Meg. I’m travelling for the next 12 months, from **England to Thailand across land**. I wanted a place to properly record this trip - no highlight reel and no restraints. Complete freedom on what I write about, and a chance to actually write. Who knows what this blog will include, but definitely don’t expect consistency or beautiful prose. 

You’re very welcome to join me on the evolution of this page and, more importantly, my trip.

*Current location:* Kazakhstan
*Next stop:* Kyrgyzstan

If you have **any** recommendations for the country I'm currently in or other counrties in the area please please please let me know! It would make my day, and you may even receive a postcard as a thank you.
