My name is Meg. I travelled for 14.5 months in 2022/23, from **England to Indonesia across land** (or at least I tried to!). I wanted a place to properly record this trip - no highlight reel and no restraints. Complete freedom on what I write about, and a chance to actually write. Who knows what this blog will include, but definitely donâ€™t expect consistency or beautiful prose. 

Thank you to everyone who joined me on the evolution of this page and, more importantly, my trip.
