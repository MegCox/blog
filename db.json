This was my first tattoo, and inspired by my first solo travel experience. It was in Mexico in 2018. It was my last night there and I sat on the beach eating a burrito, drinking a cold beer and watching the sunset, followed by the full moon rising. A flock of pelicans started to fish in the sea right in front of where I sat on the sand. It’s a moment I wanted to capture forever, and it’s a moment I think back to a lot. Takeaway point: I really like observing full moons! When I notice a full moon I make a mental note of where I am, I think back to where I was on the last one, and I think forward to where I might be on the next one. It takes all of 1 minute to do but it’s a nice moment of reflection. The world moves in cycles, and so do we. Noticing the little cycles specific to you are a personal, private affair, but observing the huge cycle of the moon seems like one that should be shared.
